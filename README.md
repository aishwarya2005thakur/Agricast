**Agri Cast - NSUT Hackathon Submission**

Problem Statement:

Farmers in developing countries like India face numerous challenges in fully utilizing their farmland's potential. These challenges include a lack of timely information about adverse weather conditions, poor soil quality, and limited exposure to advanced farming technologies. Unlike developed countries that have access to modern farming methods and tools, Indian farmers often struggle with unpredictable weather changes, inadequate soil data, and limited knowledge of innovative farming techniques.
Solution

Our app/website provides farmers with a comprehensive solution by offering real-time weather updates, soil test analysis, and data-driven recommendations for planting.
The app seamlessly integrates a weather API to deliver up-to-date information on weather conditions. This empowers farmers to make informed decisions on when and where to plant, minimizing risks and maximizing crop yields. The app's user-friendly interface ensures accessibility, even for farmers with limited technical expertise.

Tech Stack:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
 (HTML is used for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic elements, intuitive and responsive user interface.)
- Backend: Flask (a lightweight Python web framework) and SQLAlchemy (an Object-Relational Mapper) handle server-side logic and database management.
  django is responsible for handling HTTP requests and rendering data from the database to the front end, while SQLAlchemy manages the database models, which include user data, weather data, and soil quality information.
- API Integrations: The OpenWeatherMap API provides real-time weather data, allowing us to track conditions like rainfall, heatwaves, or storms based on the user's location. A location-based API helps map farmers' geographic locations, improving weather forecasts and soil condition insights specific to their areas.

Features:

1. Push Notifications: Farmers receive alerts about adverse weather conditions such as droughts, heavy rainfall, hailstorms, and heatwaves based on real-time weather data.
2. AI chatbot: chatbot with frequently asked questions to help user to resolve their doubts and know more about the website features.
3. Soil Quality Monitoring: The platform includes real-time soil quality measurements using IoT devices. This data helps farmers make informed decisions about their crops.
4. Feedback in Regional Languages: We aim to provide a user-friendly interface where farmers can give constant feedback in their regional languages, allowing better communication and personalization of advice.
5. New Farming Techniques: We offer blog posts and educational resources in regional languages to familiarize farmers with modern and innovative farming techniques that increase crop yield.

Challenges:

The following challenges faced by farmers are addressed through Agri Cast: 
- Limited crop yield despite fertile land.
- Unpredictable weather changes such as hailstorms, drought, or heavy rainfall.
- Lack of access to modern farming techniques that are being used in developed countries for better crop management and yield.
  
Future Scope:

In the future, Agri Cast aims to expand into a full-fledged website and mobile application, offering multi-language support to cater to farmers from different regions. We also plan to integrate more IoT devices to provide detailed, personalized data collection and recommendations for each farmer's unique circumstances.

Sustainability:

As a non-profit organization, Agri Cast aims to collaborate with key government bodies such as Krishi Vigyan Kendra, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, and the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR). Our goal is to empower farmers with actionable insights, modern technologies, and sustainable practices for long-term agricultural success.Agri Cast - Hackathon Submission
